# Initial notes and implementing a simple logger
**Date(s):** 2025-09-22

## Goal
Implement structured request logging for future threat detection and analysis.

## Method
- Added a logging function to server.py (log_request())

## Observations
- log_request() correctly logged basic information about requests. For example, entering:
```bash
python .\httpclient.py GET "http://localhost:8000/"
```
in the terminal added the following to logs/access.jsonl:
```json
{
    "ts": "2025-09-22T22:57:29.610882Z", 
    "ip": "127.0.0.1", 
    "method": "GET", 
    "path": "/", 
    "status": 200, 
    "length": 315
}
```

## Next Steps
- Add more information to logs (headers, response times, connection info)
